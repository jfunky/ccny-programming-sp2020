####Course Description
This course is an introduction to computer programming for art and design, appropriate for students with little or no prior experience. This course will cover programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and algorithmic problem-solving using P5.js, an open-source programming framework designed for building creative applications for the web. We will explore computation in relation to various media, such as animation, image and video processing, sound, and games, as well as artists and artworks in this realm. The course will cover a variety of techniques that students will use to build self-driven projects that will be presented and discussed in class.

####Learning Objectives
* Develop technical skills for creative computing in P5.js.
* Develop personal learning strategies, project planning, troubleshooting, debugging, and problem-solving skills.
* Learn best practices for designing software within event-driven, object-oriented and functional frameworks.
* Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas, solve problems, and bring projects from concept to completion.
* Understand the landscape of creative programming and apply critical thinking skills to analyze their work within historic, aesthetic, social, and technological contexts.

####Course Objectives
* Apply technical skills to weekly creative programming assignments, a midterm project, and a final project.
* Present and discuss their work. 
* Critically engage with their own work as well as other students, giving thoughtful and appropriate feedback.

####Course Structure 
* Discussion/Crit: Presentation of assignments, questions
* 15 minute break
* Lecture: Technical concepts presented in class
* Workshop: In-class exercises

####How to share 
* Sharing and borrowing code is a normal part of programming. You will learn that you can find solutions to problems, examples, and techniques online. You may want to build off of a project you find, or work a classmate has done. 
If you are incorporating code you found online into a project, you must cite the source. This is so others looking at your code can find the original reference, and it the polite way to engage with the creative coding community. If you continue to do this kind of work, you will benefit from this habit.
* If you are building off of a significant amount of code or recreating a project, the same rule applies. It is often a good exercise to recreate or remix pieces, but you must reference the original work. 
* If you are borrowing code from or building off of work a classmate has done, the same rule applies. If it is a significant amount of code, or an idea or concept, you should take the extra step of asking permission before using their work.

####How to ask for help
* Clearly describe what you want to happen, and what is happening instead.
* Give enough information in order for someone to recreate the problem.
* Ideally, give a link to the code itself.

###Homework submission
* Submit your homework via this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4D4Ud3hiLtZVBhaY6gwD7V3mZjl6HlQyKi7WqB6oVEAQScQ/viewform).
* It's acceptable to use the [P5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) for all assignments in this class.
    
####Readings 
P5.js has an active community with examples, projects, and references documented extensively online. Everything you need to know to pass the course will be presented in class, with open-source references linked whenever possible. Still, I think the following text (in digital or print format) is an invaluable supplement to the class. Corresponding chapters will be noted for the appropriate week.

##Grading & Attendance 
###Grade Breakdown:
* Weekly homework assignments: 40%
    - There will be weekly homework assignments consisting of coding & review of material (text, examples, video). Homework should be completed before class so we can discuss it on the day it’s due. See the schedule for assignments and due dates.
    - There are eight coding assignments each worth 10% of your homework grade or 5% of your overall grade.
    - This rubric will be used for grading projects:
        - A: Project exceeded technical expectations with additional creative effort and experimentation from the student to make it unique (not just a tech demo)
        - B: Project met expectations
        - C: Minimal effort put into project
        - D: Substandard, incomplete, or very late
        - 0: Assignment not turned in
* Engagement: 25%
     - There will be a lot of ways to show you are engaging with the material from class and your classmates:
    - Participate in class discussions
    - Help your fellow classmates and give feedback
    - Ask and answer questions
    - Never use your cell phone or laptop while your classmates are presenting work
    - **Attendance**: Please email me if you will be absent or late to class before the start of the class. More than one uncommunicated lateness of 10+ minutes will affect your Engagement grade in the course. One uncommunicated absence will halve your Engagement grade. Two will result in an Engagement grade of zero.
* Midterm Project (due March 25): 10%
    - The midterm project will be an opportunity to apply concepts from the first half of the course to create a self-defined project. It must be an interactive program that includes appropriate use of objects and functions. It will also include a short presentation on the due date, with feedback from the class.
    - Presentations should be 5 minutes to allow for 5 minutes of feedback, for a total of 10 minutes. Your presentation should include:
        - The goals and motivation for the project you made
        - Creative choices that distinguish your piece, and reflect your own point of view/voice
        - An explanation of how your code works and challenges
        - Code should be commented, formatted, and syntactically correct
        - Talking or being on your laptop/cell phone while a classmate is presenting will affect YOUR midterm grade
* Final Project (due May 20): 25%
    - The final project will be an opportunity to conceptualize and complete an engaging project that demonstrates your ability to apply the technical material of the course. You may P5 and/or other libraries.
    - 5% of your grade will be an assessment of your project proposal and planning that allows you to bring your project to completion.
    - Presentations should be 5 minutes to allow for 5 minutes of feedback, for a total of 10 minutes. Your presentation should include:
        - The goals and motivation for the project you made
        - Creative choices that distinguish your piece, and reflect your own point of view/voice
        - An explanation of how your code works and challenges
        - Code should be submitted in an appropriate format as well as commented, formatted, and syntactically correct
        - Talking or being on your laptop/cell phone while a classmate is presenting will affect YOUR grade
